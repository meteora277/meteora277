Hello my name is **Justin Diaz** I am a fledgling web developer who started learning in 2020 when the pandemic rocked the world. I am a **long time barista**, with starbucks for more than 10 years. At one point i was working at 2 cafe jobs daily, sometimes working for more than 13 hours. I am very accustomed to fast paced environments, long shifts learning on the fly, and working in a team. 


**I really like building things.** Some of my hobbies include, cosplaying, drawing, building computers, and gaming. Alot of the time I like to jump straight into the deep end and hope to see what comes out at the end.


My post bootcamp goal right now is to become **full stack developer** and start applying for jobs. Hopefully land one at a place where i can constantly learn new things. 
Roles I am looking to fill :
* Junior Developer
* Front End Developer
* Full Stack Developer
* Software developer
* React / React Native Developer


My personal goals are to Work on some passion project, such as; creating a beginner tutorial for the trading card game **Flesh and Blood** (I just recenlty found out about the game from my girlfriend, and am just learning how to play. I was surprised there was no beginner friendly web app to help newbies get into the game.) Another project i'd like to make is a tl;dr guide hosting website. Where 10 min long youtube videos can be condensed into a tl;dr recipe styled page.


I really have been enjoying coding during the last couple months. I have the tendency to **go down the rabbit hole** when i'm reviewing API docs. I have delved into learning a lot of different languages. Some of them include


* HTML / CSS 
  * most common tags
  * still learning semantic tags
  * flexbox / grid
  * responive web design
  

* Javascript
  * functions
  * objects
  

* React 
  * styled-components
  * react-router
  * functional / Class components
  * state 
  * component lifecycle methods
  * Hooks (useState, useRef, useContext, useEffect)


* SQL
  * CRUD
* basics of Node/ Express
* Figma



I am also a full on weeb, recommend me some anime if you know anything good.
